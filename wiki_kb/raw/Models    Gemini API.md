## Model version name patterns

Gemini models are available in either *stable*, *preview*, *latest*, or *experimental* versions.

### Stable

Points to a specific stable model. Stable models usually don't change. Most production apps should use a specific stable model.

For example: `gemini-2.5-flash`.

### Preview

Points to a preview model which may be used for production. Preview models will typically have billing enabled, might come with more restrictive rate limits and will be deprecated with at least 2 weeks notice.

For example: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025`.

### Latest

Points to the latest release for a specific model variation. This can be a stable, preview or experimental release. This alias will get hot-swapped with every new release of a specific model variation. A **2-week notice** will be provided through email before the version behind latest is changed.

For example: `gemini-flash-latest`.

### Experimental

Points to an experimental model which will typically be not be suitable for production use and come with more restrictive rate limits. We release experimental models to gather feedback and get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly.

Experimental models are not stable and availability of model endpoints is subject to change.
